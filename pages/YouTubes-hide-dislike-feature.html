	So only like an hour ago, YouTube has made the blockbuster decision to basically get rid of dislikes. They tweeted this from their official Twitter account. They said, in response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike, campaigns were testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks. Example below in the example looks like this. 
	<br><br>
	You can clearly see the likes and you can't see the dislikes. So we already have an option that allows you to hide both likes and dislikes. But this is going to be the first time where you can exclusively choose to hide only dislikes. They said creators. You'll still be able to see the exact number of likes and dislikes in YouTube studio for viewers. So you guys watching this video, if you're in the experiment, you can still like or dislike a video to share feedback with creators and help tune the recommendations you see on YouTube. So this was obviously met with outrage and I'd say rightfully so, because this will allow a bunch of scam channels and click bait channels to, like, make terrible content and not get any visible repercussions for it is a point that a YouTube name critical made. He said scam channels just got a huge boner from this change. 
	<br><br>
	Hiding dislikes will make it harder for people to know if a video is promoting a scam. Speaking of, scams are everywhere on YouTube right now, especially with common bots. A lot of times they attempt to lure you to their channel and make you click on their video. And now, like YouTube says, if they have the option to hide the entirety of their dislikes on their video, it'll be much harder to determine whether it's a scam or not. Not to mention all those videos that people make where they just like blatantly click bait. They completely lie about the contents of the video or whatever. And now if they want to, they can hide that and make the video not look as bad. So new viewers who just stumbled upon the video will be like, oh, this video doesn't have any dislikes, so it must not be click bait. So then they sit through the entire video and now they just got fooled.
<br><br>
	So let's read some feedback. Somebody said the dislike count helps determine the worth of a video. There must be a better way to counter targeted campaigns like don't include dislikes that are clicked within first five seconds of the video. I think that's pretty solid, to be honest. There's a lot of times people, if they really hate someone, will just dislike their video right when they click on it. So if they were able to negate that in some sort of way, that would be a good way to stop hate campaigns or at least slow them down. A YouTube rename, the ACT man said you are actually promoting bad content by hiding dislikes. 
	<br><br>
	That's what partially keeps people accountable and lets other viewers know if something is worth watching. And someone made a funny comment, said, how the hell are we going to show hate to YouTube? Rewind now. People are making jokes at YouTube. Only did this because every YouTube rewind they make, it's just like bomb. But yeah, I definitely disagree with this decision. That's just my thoughts on the situation. YouTube has made this crazy decision. Let me know what you guys thoughts are on the situation, please, if you like, in the video, if you enjoyed it. And subscribe for more Seyoum.
