	What's up guys, iOS 15 is just over a month away from being unveiled at WWDC 20 2 1 and the weeks have been very limited this year we haven't really seen nearest many leaks as we had for iOS 14 last year but today we finally have some legit trustworthy news about what we can expect to see an iOS and iPadOS 15 and man I am excited and if you have an iPad you're gonna be very excited to hear about "the most significant update to the device is home screen since first launching the product in 2010”.
	<br><br>
	So as we know Apple 's worldwide developers conference takes place in early June every year and for 20 2 1 it goes from June 7 through June 11, & this is where apple showcases all of their latest software for the iPhone, iPad, the Mac, the Apple TV, The Apple Watch & potentially maybe AR/VR Glasses or something new this year. 
<br>
	So on the first day of the conference we get the first beta for every device so that means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 beta 1 will be on our devices if you are a registered developer on June 7th. 
<br><br>
	Today we have even more pieces to the puzzle that is iOS 15. So we know that the release date for the first beta is again on June 7th & and now we have some credible information about what could be changed in this next major iOS and iPadOS update, So this fresh news comes from a report from mark German at Bloomberg who published a piece today titled apple plans notifications, iPad Home Screen upgrade for iOS 15. And I’m this report we hear about numerous features that apple had planned for iOS 15 and the first one that’s mentioned is about notifications and how iOS 15 will let you customize and pretty much have more control on how you see and receive notifications on your iPhone.
	<br><br>
	The company is planning a new feature that will allow users to set different notification preferences, Such as if the phone makes a sound or not, depending on ther current status. The enhancement will come in the form of a new menu that lets users select if they are driving, working, sleeping or custom categories of their choosing. The menu will be shown on the updated lock screen and in control center, the iPhone and iPad's menu for quickly accessing settings. 
	<br /><br />
	Introduced to users in September last year, iOS 14 was very popular with most of its features. The most striking feature of iOS 14 was the Widget feature, which was improved compared to Android. Some users made comments such as "Apple is stealing from Android". In addition, which models will buy from IOS 15 is a matter of curiosity.

<br /><br />
<b>Models that will get iOS 15</b><br /><br />

According to reports from a France-based internet site, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, SE models will not be able to benefit from the iOS 15 update. In addition to these models, the models that are thought to receive the IOS 15 update are as follows:<br /><br />

IPhone 7 series, 8 series, X model, XS series, 11 series, SE 2020 model, 12 series and 13 / 12S series, which is expected to be released in the future.
The iPad models will receive updates from the iPad Mini 5, iPad 6,7,8, iPad Air 3,4, Pro series 9.7, 10.5, 11, 12.9 and 2021 models.
When will the new version of iOS be active?
<br /><br />
New versions of iOS are usually offered to users either in September or when the new model is released. This year, IPhone took a new step and presented IOS 14 to users before IPhone 12 was released. The new version, IOS 15, is thought to be activated with the 13 series. Accordingly, IOS 15 can be offered to users in September. In addition, it is thought that the introduction of IOS 15 will be presented at WWDC, a traditional event of the company, that is, the World Developers Conference, as was done to the previous ones. WWDC is held in June.<br /><br />
<b>What will be offered in iOS 15?</b><br /><br />

For now, clear information has not been obtained, but according to estimates, the following features will be offered to users.
<br /><br />
<b>Always on Display feature:</b><br /><br />

This feature is among the most anticipated features. There are many claims about this feature. In addition, it is not even clear that this feature will be included in IOS 15. This highly anticipated feature may be in the IPhone 13 series.

<b>Advanced dark mode:</b><br /><br />
Among the rumors, there will be an improved version of dark mode in the new version. In addition, it is said that with the dark mode developed, there may be changes in the interface and it will have a wider effect.
<br /><br />
<b>Privacy enhancements:</b><br /><br />

Privacy, one of the most important features of Apple, can become different with the new version. Within the scope of rumors, with the new update, the contents on the clipboard cannot be copied without user permission. In addition, separate permissions will be required to view the clipboard contents of the applications.
<br /><br />
<b>Application archive:</b><br /><br />

This feature, which comes with IOS 14, seems to be developed in IOS 15. The archive, which is normally accessed by going to the right side of the screen, can be accessed with a single click with the new version.
<br /><br />
<b>Split screen mode:</b><br /><br />

The split screen mode seen on Android before Apple was introduced to users on iPad devices. This feature, which most users expect, may come with the new version IOS 15. With this feature, users will be able to split their screens and perform two operations at the same time.
According to the claims put forward, IOS 15 may include the features mentioned above. However, no exact information was received from Apple about this issue. With the introduction of IOS 15, we will see what the new features are.
